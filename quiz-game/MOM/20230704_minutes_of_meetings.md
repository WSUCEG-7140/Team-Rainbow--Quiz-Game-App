Great work team! We have made progress on the faculty home page, edited and deleted the questions in the quiz, and implemented the feature to display error messages. Let's keep up the good work! 

## Decisions Made:

During the meeting, the team made the following decisions:

Let's make sure we have enough time to devote to styling for each feature, developing the admin profile and making sure our firebase setup is secure. Additionally, I think it's important that we don't forget about automation testing - let's make sure we allocate enough time for that.
